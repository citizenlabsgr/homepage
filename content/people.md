There is nothing more important than the people that volunteer with Citizen Labs.

<br>

We are people that live, work, and play in Grand Rapids metro area and more broadly in West Michigan. Citizen Labs provide people with the permission, inspiration, motivation, and place to collaborate with others to improve our communities.

<br>

We ask questions. We experiment and sometimes fail, but understand that learning cannot happen without failure. We apply what we learn and work to always make improvements.

<br>

We come together in-person to share successes, seek support, and work on individual and group projects. When we are not together in-person, we work together online. Citizen Labs has a [Code of Conduct](/conduct/) that applies to all of our activities, events, and digital forums. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind.
