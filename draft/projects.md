## Our Projects

Welcome to Citizen Labs, a place for innovation and citizen engagement focused on improving our community.

We work together with our community to use open data and open source technology to promote transparency, better understand problems, make better choices, and provide solutions that work.

We need developers, designers, data geeks, leaders, and idea-makers that like to work, share, and learn in an inclusive environment on projects that are important to our community.
