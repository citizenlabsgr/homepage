## What is Open Source?

We ask questions. We experiment and sometimes fail, but understand that learning cannot happen without failure. We apply what we learn and work to always make improvements.

We come together in-person to share successes, seek support, and work on individual and group projects. When we are not together in-person, we work together online. Citizen Labs has a [Code of Conduct](/conduct/) that applies to all of our activities, events, and digital forums. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind.
